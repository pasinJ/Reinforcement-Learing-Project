# Reinforcement-Learing-Project
This is a final project of Reinforcement Learning course that I took while study at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. 
In this project, I use RL library in python to solve the Breakout Atari game from Gym's environment. 
I use RL techniques that I have learned from this course and also try to explore other advance techniques for solving complicated problem as Atari game.
